This custom SplineUser component creates a surface out of multiple splines. To use it, attach the MultipleSplineSurface on an object and reference a SplineComputer as you would do with any other SplineUser. The referenced SplineComputer will serve as the starting spline. To create a surface, create another spline and reference it using the "Add Spline" field in the Paths section. This will generate a surface between the starting spline and the newly referenced one. You can add as many paths as you like and the surface will get extended to support them
